Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process by which we design, develop and maintain softwares over time . These software should be reliable, scalable ,cost efficient and easy to navigate through by users.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
software Engineering was born in 1968 to address the software crisis.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project scope, feasibility, and requirements.
Analysis – Gather and analyze user needs.
Design – Create system architecture and UI/UX design.
Coding – Write and integrate code.
Testing – Verify software functionality and performance.
Deployment – Release software to production.
Maintenance – Fix bugs and update features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodologies may be applied when building a banking system where all requirements are fixed while 
agile methodologies when developing a mobile app that demands frequent updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software for defects and ensures quality.
Project Manager: Oversees project timelines, manages risks, and ensures team coordination.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools like debugging, code completion, and version control (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS): Track code changes, facilitate collaboration, and prevent data loss (e.g., Git, GitHub).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and testing → Implement automated testing.
Managing complex codebases → Use modular programming and documentation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components
Integration Testing: Verifies interactions between components.
System Testing: Tests the entire application.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the system meets user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the continuous learning of AI inputs that results to more clear, simple and straightforward outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague: who was the president of kenya.
improv : who was the second president of kenya.
the second prompts directs the AI directly to the answer i need.
